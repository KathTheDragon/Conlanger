==================================== To-do ====================================
=== Bug-fixes ===
Doesn't seem to be checking exceptions correctly (not urgent-urgent)

Potentially going to be overhauled in the near future

=== Features ===

=== Style ===
Consider where to raise/handle exceptions

=== Mathematical model ===
r is the number of segments
p is the 'dropoff rate'
f(n) = p**n*(1-p)/(1-p**r) is the frequency of the nth most frequent segment (frequencies sum to 1)

p must be determined by observing that a = (1-p)/(1-p**r) is the frequency of the most frequent segment. From this, we
can estimate p ≈ 1-a, and with a first-order correction, p ≈ (1-a)+(a*(1-a)**r)/(1-a*r*(1-a)**(r-1)).

P(n) = (1-p**n)/(1-p**r) is the cumulative frequency of the first n segments, and can be found by summing over f(n)

A probability distribution can then be obtained by finding the inverse of P(n). Let x be a continuous random variable
from 0 to 1 (say, random.random()). Then n = floor(log(1-x*(1-p**r),p))

Obtaining a variant with a peak can be done by using two distributions, one reversed, with their modes overlapping. This
can be done by taking the range of x corresponding to the reversed section and rescaling it as follows, where a is the
frequency of the mode, and c the cumulative frequency of the bins before the mode: x -> 1-x/(a+c). Thus, when x<c, we
use a distribution with m+1 bins, mode a/(a+c), and the rescaled random variable. For the remainder, we use a
distribution with r-m bins, mode a/(1-c), and a rescaled variable x -> (x-c)/(1-c). Note that the mode belongs to this
second distribution.
